# Module-4-Pandas-Challenge
In this challenge, the assignment outlines the steps to be taken to analyze a school district's standardardized test data for math and reading scores. Information about each school's test results also are provided so that analysis can be conducted at the school level for districtwide comparison.
After downloading the PyCitySchools_Starter solution, which provided the desired format for the assignment, the next steps were to provide a series of calculations and build dataframes from the results of the calculations.
Calculations included highest-performing schools by overall passing percentage, lowest-performing schools by overall passing percentage, cost per student, and scores by grade.
In working on this assignment, it was discussed in part of three online tutoring sessions with Steven Thomas and via Slack messages with classmates Jennifer Grubb and Adam Gostinger. An AskBCS session with Bigyan K. helped correct some calculation issues.
