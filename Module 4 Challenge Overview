In this challenge, the assignment outlines the steps to be taken to analyze a school district's standardardized test data for math and reading scores. Information about each school's test results also are provided so that analysis can be conducted at the school level for districtwide comparison.
After downloading the PyCitySchools_Starter solution, which provided the desired format for the assignment, the next steps were to provide a series of calculations and build dataframes from the results of the calculations.
Calculations included highest-performing schools by overall passing percentage, lowest-performing schools by overall passing percentage, cost per student, and scores by grade.
In working on this assignment, it was discussed in part of two online tutoring sessions with Steven Thomas and via Slack messages with classmates Jennifer Grubb and Adam Gostinger. Online resources inlcuded checking w3schools.com
During my work, as I worked to create one section of coding, it disrupted several other cells of my work. At this point, I feel I must submit as much work as I have so that I can move on to other assignments that are due.
Based on the analysis I could complete, there is a strong correlation shown between the highest-population schools having the lowest-performing students on math and reading scores. Bailey, Johnson, Hernandez, Rodriquez, Figueroaand Huang high schools were the six largest schools and were also among the lowest-scoring schools.
An even stronger correlation is shown in examing the highest-scoring schools on average. The top five schools, Cabrara, Thomas, Pena, Wilson an dGriffin, are all charter schools.
However, comparing cost per student to successful outcomes resulted in a more tenuous correlation. Some of the top-scoring charter schools ranked near the top of per-student funding, as did some of the lowest-scoring, larger student body district-run schools.
